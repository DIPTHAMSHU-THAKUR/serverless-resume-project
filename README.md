# AWS Serverless Resume Website

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a serverless resume website hosted on AWS.  
It displays my resume along with a dynamic visitor counter powered by cloud services.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical knowledge of cloud computing and serverless architecture.
